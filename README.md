# Ignite-Your-Future-App
Group Project: App developed to Mobile Devices Programming 

This proposal was submitted by Dr. Paulo Fazendeiro.

## Context and Objectives

The main objective of this work is to design and prototype a system 
(consisting of two applications and a remote database that interconnects them) that allows registration in 
predictably free or symbolically priced events, namely events that combine concepts such as bootcamp, 
teambuilding and STEM. (eg, Ignite Your Future, Tech Week for High School Students that has been held annually at UBI).
At the same time, the application must provide all relevant information about the event as well as disclose any and all promotional material as it is created.
As described in the features, it is assumed that the system has an application for users who will register for events, 
and an application for administrators.

##  Functionalities

The basic set of features to be implemented is set out below and will have as its case study the Ignite Your Future event. 
The administrators mobile app should allow:

1. Define a new event, by name, description, age range of participants, location and calendar of the event 
(the data model must accompany this functionality);
2. Check the number of entries in an event;
3. Send information / news to all event registrants.

The mobile application for event registrants should allow:

• That a user enters their name, city and date of birth. This data should be stored locally only unless you register for an event.
• View information of all events that can be registered;
• The application must allow logging in an event, effectively sending the data to the remote database 
(the data model must accompany this functionality);
• The app should receive notifications of information / news that has been entered by the administrators for an event it has subscribed to
